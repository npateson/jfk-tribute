        <h2 class="subhead"> Brief Bio</h2>
        <h3 class="subhead">John F. Kennedy was the 35th President of the United States (1961-1963), the youngest man elected to the office.</h3>
        <ul>
        <li><p>On November 22, 1963, when he was hardly past his first thousand days in office, John Fitzgerald Kennedy was killed by an assassin’s bullets as his motorcade wound through Dallas, Texas. Kennedy was the youngest man elected President; he was the youngest to die.</p></li>
        <li><p>Of Irish descent, he was born in Brookline, Massachusetts, on May 29, 1917. Graduating from Harvard in 1940, he entered the Navy. In 1943, when his PT boat was rammed and sunk by a Japanese destroyer, Kennedy, despite grave injuries, led the survivors through perilous waters to safety.</p></li>
        <li><p>Back from the war, he became a Democratic Congressman from the Boston area, advancing in 1953 to the Senate. He married Jacqueline Bouvier on September 12, 1953. In 1955, while recuperating from a back operation, he wrote Profiles in Courage, which won the Pulitzer Prize in history.</p></li>
        <li><p>In 1956 Kennedy almost gained the Democratic nomination for Vice President, and four years later was a first-ballot nominee for President. Millions watched his television debates with the Republican candidate, Richard M. Nixon. Winning by a narrow margin in the popular vote, Kennedy became the first Roman Catholic President.</p></li>
        <li><p>His Inaugural Address offered the memorable injunction: “Ask not what your country can do for you–ask what you can do for your country.” As President, he set out to redeem his campaign pledge to get America moving again. His economic programs launched the country on its longest sustained expansion since World War II; before his death, he laid plans for a massive assault on persisting pockets of privation and poverty.</p></li>
            </ul>
        <h2 class="subhead">His ambition and legacy</h2>
        <blockquote>"Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe, in order to assure the survival and success of liberty." ... JFK quotes</blockquote>

          <li> He was the youngest-elected president in history, coming into office at the height of the Cold War -- a man endowed with grace, good looks, and a wide-ranging intellect.</li>
           <li>"He had a gift for touching the best, humane, most idealistic impulses in America," said historian Robert Caro. "He had a gift for rallying the country." </li>
           <li>On May 25, 1961, President John F. Kennedy announced before a special joint session of Congress the dramatic and ambitious goal of sending an American safely to the Moon before the end of the decade. A number of political factors affected Kennedy's decision and the timing of it. In general, Kennedy felt great pressure to have the United States "catch up to and overtake" the Soviet Union in the "space race." </li>
           
          <h3> Assassination of JFK</h3>
          <p>John F. Kennedy was assassinated at 12:30 p.m. on 22nd November 1963, in Dealey Plaza, Dallas, Texas while traveling with his wife Jackie Kennedy. The assassin Lee Harvey Oswald denied having committed the crime and was never tried in court as he was fatally shot by a Dallas nightclub owner Jack Ruby. Ruby said he was distraught by JFK’s murder and also wanted to spare Jackie Kennedy the discomfort of a trial. The President’s Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy concluded that Oswald acted alone in the shooting. However a later committee concluded in 1979 that Kennedy was “probably assassinated as a result of a conspiracy.” Polls have found that only 20 – 30% of the American population believe that Oswald had acted alone. John F. Kennedy remains the last American president to be assassinated.</p>
